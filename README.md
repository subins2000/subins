# Subin

This was a project I started building in 2011 to learn programming. Written in PHP, it's a network of sites like Google (and heavily inspired).

At the time I didn't know `git`, so source code was backed up into different folders. It was during my pre-teen age of 11 & 12 when I started writing all these code. So it's pretty bad. It worked but is vulnerable to **SQL Injection** and many other stuff.

## Tech

* `geany` as editor (used `gedit` too IIRC)
* Ubuntu 10.04
* Apache server
* PHP 5
* MySQL

## Components

Subins composed of different sites. Each of them are stored in separate folders. Since they're in PHP5, it's hard to set them up now and make it work. But from looking at the source code, here's what I think the folders are :

* `accounts` - Accounts site like accounts.google.com
* `analytics` - Like Google Analytics
* `apps` - Like Chrome Web Store
* `chat` - Chat site
* `fd` - FriendsHood, a social network like Facebook
* `games` - Similar to Chrome Web Store I guess
* `get` - File download site like SourceForge
* `music` - Music streaming site
* `shortener` - A URL shortener like goo.gl
* `static` - CDN site
* `subins` - Search engine
* `quiz` - A quiz app like Who Wants To Be A Millionaire
* `videos` - Like YouTube
